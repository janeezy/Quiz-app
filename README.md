# simple quiz app that verifies the accuracy of the user’s response and offers a collection of questions and answers that have been carefully chosen Using dynamic programming, it moves through the questions.

# create a container div tag which will be the main container for our quiz app.

# Using a div tag with the class “quiz-header” we will now build the framework for our quiz container.

We’ll design the main heading for our quiz app using the <h2> tag.
Now with the help of an unordered list, we will be creating the list of options in the quiz app.
Inside the unordered list, we will create a different input tag with the type “radio” to select one correct option in the quiz.
Then, using the button tag, we will create a submit button for submitting the last answer

# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS, like HTML and JavaScript, is a key component of the World Wide Web.

# After we’ve added the CSS code, we’ll go over it step by step. To save time, you can simply copy this code and paste it into your IDE. Let us now examine our code step by step.

Step1:We’ll start by importing the Poppin typeface from Google Fonts using the import link. We’ll use the global selection to set the margin and padding to “zero” and the box-sizing to the border box.

Step2:To the container for our quiz app, we will now apply to style. The background colour of the quiz app will be set to “white” using the class selector (.quiz-container), and its edges will be given a curved appearance using the border-radius property. We’ll use the width attribute to specify the minimum and maximum widths to 600px and 95vw, respectively.

Step3:Using the element tag selector (h2), we will now add styling to each element. We will set the padding to “1 rem,” centre the text using the text-align property, and leave the margin at zero.

# The ul tag selection will also be used to set the list style to “none,” the padding to “zero,” the text’s font size to “1.2 rem,” and the cursor type to “pointer.”The width will be set to 100%, the text-align property will be used to centre the submitted text, and the background colour will be changed to “purple” in order to provide some flair to the submit button.

Step1:In order to store the various quiz questions inside our quiz app, we will first build an array variable named “quiz data,” after which we will construct some constant variables and use the document. The getelementById () method will be used to select every html element in our quiz app.

# The text of our html elements will also be changed, and at the end of the quiz button, our submit button will be changed to a restart button. In a similar manner, we will also create a loadquiz() function. Through this function, we will display the question inside our quiz app using the innerText property.
